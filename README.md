# <b>Animation Pose Editor</b>

*This is a Python script for Autodesk Maya.*

Update an existing animation by modifying a pose, and applying that relative modification to a range on the timeline. Falloff to the modification value can be adjusted to allow for smooth or sharp transition between the old animation and the new adjusted pose.
